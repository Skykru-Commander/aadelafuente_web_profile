# Personal Web Profile
### of Angelo dela Fuente for CMSC 207 Mini-Project

This is a personal web profile built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a mini-project to practice creating an HTML page, applying CSS to enhance layout and using JavaScript for interactivity, making it responsive, and gaining experience with debugging and refining a web page. The process involved first, as demonstrated in the book of Hatter, *CoderDojo Nano: Create with Code - Build Your Own Website*, creating the folder structure with `aadelafuente_web_profile` as the main folder with 3 subfolders namely `css`, `js`, and `images`. Then the main web page `about_me.html` was created along with `style.css` to style the page, and `script.js`to add interactivity were created respectively. Coding was done in Visual Studio Code. Illustration was done using draw.io software.

## Features
The webpage include the following:
1. A **navigation menu** for browsing
2. A short **About Me** section with profile picture
3. A **Hobbies and Interests** section showing alerts when clicked
4. A **Contact Info** section with email link
5. **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile screens
